    "This exam is graded out of 100 points. There are 55 points in Problem 1 and 45 points in Problem 2. Each problem is divided into multiple parts, some of which may be completed independently of others. The exam is intended to require approximately 90 minutes, and may be worked on at any time between the hours of 12:00am and 11:59, Pacific Time, on Friday, October 30th. You are free to work on the exam in excess of 90 minutes during this time period. \n",

    "2. Being stuck on Part (A) doesn't mean you can't do Part (B)! Do your best, and again write down everything you can think of that is relevant. Write the code that you would expect to run if part (A) were working. Explicitly state that you are unable to test your code in (B) because you couldn't get (A) to run. If your answers fully demonstrate understanding of the problem, then you can receive **up to full credit** this way. "
