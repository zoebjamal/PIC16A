    "In \"For-Loops and Comprehensions,\" we introduced the for-loop -- the simplest way to iterate through data. In this lecture, we'll add `while` loops for iteration, as well as `if` statements for conditional branching. \n",

    "1. Iteration (repeating an operation)\n",
    "2. Branching (performing different operations depending on conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll move quickly through this material, since these concepts should be familiar from your experience with PIC10A -- only the syntax changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two important pieces of syntax: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The declaration of both loops and conditionals must end with a colon `:`. \n",
    "2. **Whitespace matters.** The body of a loop or branching statement **must be indented**, else Python will throw a syntax error. "

    "## Iteration with While-Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A *while-loop* will repeat a given sequence of commands as long as a boolean (logical) condition evaluates to `True`. The first time that that condition evaluates to `False`, the loop will halt -- no more iterations will take place. The primary application of while-loops is to iterate when you are not sure how many iterations are required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike for-loops, it is necessary to initialize the variable of iteration prior to beginning the loop. \n",
