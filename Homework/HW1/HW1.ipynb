    "In this problem, we'll simulate the *simple random walk*, perhaps the most important discrete-time stochastic process. Random walks are commonly used to model phenomena in physics,  chemistry, biology, and finance. In the simple random walk, at each timestep we flip a fair coin. If heads, we move foward one step; if tails, we move backwards. Let \"forwards\" be represented by positive integers, and \"backwards\" be represented by negative integers. For example, if we are currently three steps backwards from the starting point, our position is `-3`. \n",
