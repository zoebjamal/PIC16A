    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In your project, you are required to demonstrate the use of decision trees and multinomial logistic regression classifiers. Groups of three must also demonstrate the use of one additional model. In this homework assignment, you will write a detailed report that will largely fulfill this requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one machine learning model, other than decision trees and multinomial logistic regression (unless you are a group of 2 -- see below). Some possibilities include, but are not limited to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Support vector classifiers (`sklearn.svm.SVC`). Complexity parameter is called `gamma`. Higher values create more complex models)\n",
    "- K-nearest-neighbor classifiers (`sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier`). Complexity parameter is called `n_neighbors`. Higher values create less complex models. When working with KNN models, it is helpful to standardize your data columns first. For this purpose, `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` can be used. \n",
    "- Multilayer perceptron classifier, a kind of neural network (`sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier`). The complexity is controlled by the number of neurons and layers, as specified by the `hidden_layer_sizes` parameter -- more neurons and layers correspond to more complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should consult the documentation for these models, which is available online or via `?`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Groups of 2\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a group of 2, you are not required to use an additional model and may instead use multinomial logistic regression for this assignment. Please note this in your submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Multinomial logistic regression (`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`). The complexity is controlled by `C`, the inverse regularization strength. Larger values of `C` correspond to more complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Replicate and expand the pipeline from Discussion 15, substituting out decision trees for your chosen classifier. In particular, you should: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load** the data. \n",
    "2. **Split the data** into training and test sets. \n",
    "3. Write one or more functions to **clean and transform the data** as needed. You should add comments and function docstrings as appropriate to describe to your reader what you are doing and why. Apply your functions to the training and test sets. \n",
    "4. **Select 3 columns (features)** from the data. You are required to use at least one qualitative feature (like Island or Sex). We saw one way of doing this \"by hand\" during a previous Live Lecture, but there are many other approaches as well. You may wish to delegate one group member to do some research on the topic of \"feature selection in Python with sklearn\". \n",
    "4. **Use cross-validation** to estimate optimal model complexity (*Note*: cross-validation is also an acceptable way to perform feature selection -- you may use it above, but you are required to use it here). \n",
    "5. Having selected your features and an optimal complexity, **evaluate your model on the test set.** \n",
    "6. **Inspect** a few instances in which your trained model gave the wrong answer on the test set. Explain why your model was \"tricked\" in this case? Create and comment on a confusion matrix -- [check Monday's lecture notes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PhilChodrow/PIC16A/blob/master/content/ML/digits.ipynb) for an example. \n",
    "7. **Plot the decision regions** for your model. These are covered in a recent live lecture, and code required to construct them is below. The horizontal and vertical axes should be the two quantitative predictor variables that you selected. Create a separate plot for each possible value of the qualitative predictor variable that you selected. For example, if you chose `Sex` as your qualitative variable, you should show two plots, with the decision regions for Female and Male penguins separately. Add appropriate axis labels and any other measures required to make your plots look professional. Add commentary to contextualize the mistakes that your model made. \n",
    "    - You are welcome to use the [code from live lecture](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PhilChodrow/PIC16A/blob/master/live_lectures/live-lecture-22.ipynb) for this purpose. A common pitfall when using code for manual decision regions is re-training a model (using `model.fit()`) once for each plot. You should ensure that your model is only trained once, and that its predictions are then extracted for each plot. \n",
    "    - Another good approach is to use a built-in function for decision regions, like from the package `mlxtend` ([link](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/installation/)). You can install this package by running the code `conda install mlxtend` in a Python code cell. (*Note*: this isn't really the recommended way to install packages in Anaconda, but because we haven't covered environment management it's ok to do here). \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout, add helpful explanation for your reader. For example, you should explain the idea behind cross-validation; anything you are able to learn about how your model works; how to interpret the optimal complexity parameter; and why your model went wrong in certain cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will be graded by me personally, and will be graded using a rubric very similar to that used for the final project. I'll also give you some feedback indicating how you can improve. To get the most benefit out of this feedback, you should **treat this homework as a rehearsal for the full project.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution should **not** fit in a single code cell -- a good, readable, and adequately-explained solution will likely require at least one code cell for each of the eight steps above. Make sure that there is plenty of surrounding text explanation and comments. Add code cells and plenty of markdown cells as needed. You can also use section headers with `###` to organize your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your comments and explanation should be written to an imaginary reader who has never encountered the Palmer Penguins data set before, and knows less about machine learning than you do. Explain your steps. Why train-test split? Why cross-validation? Why decision regions? And so on. If you'd like, imagine that you are writing to a time-traveller version of you from two weeks ago. \n",

In addition to this, we need to convert some text information to numerical data so that our model can understand it.

    "Now, we need to actually see which combination is the best in terms of accurately predicting the species of the penguin. For this, we used `cross_val_score`. K-fold cross validation takes a small piece of the training data (say 10%) and hides it from the model, akin to a mini test set. We train the model on the remaining 90% and then evaluate its performance based on the 10% that we hid. We can then hide a *different* 10% of the data and do the same thing. We can repeat this many times to eventually get an average picture of how our model may perform on the real test data. This is very useful when evaluating optimal complexity of a model, but can also be used for feature selection. To do this, we initialized a `best_score` and `best_combo` value and list to `0` and `empty` respectively. We then looped through all the viable combinations we generated from the previous code cell and trained an `SVM` model with these columns using cross validation. We then checked to see if the `cv_score` was better than the `best_score`. If it was, update the current `best_score` with the new `cv_score`, and update the `best_combo` list with the current combination. "

    "### Choosing Optimal Model Complexity\n",
    "Now that we have the best columns, we need to see what the best model complexity is. The complexity parameter for SVM is called `gamma`. In essence, a higher `gamma` value will create a more complex model. While this may sound good, it could lead to *overfitting*. This is a phenomenon that occurs when our model complexity is so high that it perfectly (or almost perfectly) classifies the training data (that it has seen), but performs far far worse on the test data (that it has not seen). In order to choose the optimal model complexity, we will again use K-fold cross validation. Here however, instead of modifying the columns, we will modify the `gamma` value. In order to show this information clearly, we can plot the decrease in CV score due to the increasing model complexity. "

    "A decision region works by predicting a species across points in a data space. Here, we made a grid of points based on the minimum and maximum values for `Culmen Length (mm)` and `Culmen Depth (mm)` and created separate plots for each `Island`, since it is our qualitative variable. The colors on our graph represent the values of `Culmen Length (mm)` and `Culmen Depth (mm)` for which our model predicts a certain species. We can clearly see that the Decision Regions change depending on what `Island` we are looking at. We can also see that three of the penguins lie outside of the Decision Region for their species -- these are the same penguins that were incorrectly classified by our model when we were looking at the confusion matrix earlier.
